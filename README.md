# http://www.atchyutn.com

This is the source code to my personal website which is hosted at http:www.atchyutn.com

## How it's built

This site is built with basic HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JS

### Sass/CSS

SCSS is used to style the website. Bootstrap is used as the grid system to give me full control of the website.

### JS

Nothing fancy here, just standard JS with no frameworks (such as jQuery).

## Misc

### Deployments

Deployments are done using CircleCi. CircleCI watches the master branch for changes and deploys to the live site.
